        Dear Baby,<br /><br />

        Hiiii, have been skipping letters for a few days now so I will try to get back into habit.<br />
        First of all, I didn't really get to express just how pretty you are. I have looked at the video you let me save countless times. You are soooooo pretty. Your eyes are literally so perfect, and your nose, your cheeks, and your lips. I can't stop looking at you. I love the way your hair falls on your shoulders. I genuinely wanna hold you and hug you tightly for so long. You look so good, I can't believe still that you look so good.<br /><br />

        I want to thank you so much for doing so much for me and being here for me. You have no idea ‚Äî pretty much every other text from you makes me smile ear to ear.<br /><br />

        Thank you so much for being yourself, I don't want you to change ever, even a bit.<br />
        I really want to meet you so badly, I want to be near you. I feel frustrated, wish we could skip to the days where we are near each other. I am going to take care of you for all my life.<br /><br />

        Also, sorry for sending you to study. I hope you know I only say it for you. My greedy self wants you to be on top of me instead.<br /><br />

  <p>
    Dear Megha,<br /><br />

    Thank you so much for today. I am still blushing from the endless compliments you gave me. I have said this many times but it can't be said enough times that you are such an amazing person.<br /><br />

    I already hold you so dear to me and honestly if you told me to do anything for you, I would give it the best shot I can even if I can't do it, and I hope you know, whatever problem arises for you, you need to share it with me cause it is our problem. You can literally share anything to me, at any time, never think if it is the right time or not.<br /><br />

    I wish we meet really soon cause I can't stop thinking about you. I just wanna see your beauty in real life, and see how pretty you really are. I might get a heart attack to be honest when I look into your eyes. I wanna touch you, and hold your cheeks and see how soft they really are. So many things I wanna do with you and to you. I want to hold you and tell you that I love you so many times.<br /><br />

    You are so fucking amazing, like stop making me fall in love with you even more. Do you know I won't literally be able to fall in love with anybody else now cause I met you? Honestly, you should take the blame of being so perfect and being so nice to me. I hope you do know that I will always blame you for it.<br /><br />

    You seem like the most genuine person on earth, you listen to everything I say and you remember it, that means soooooo much to me I can't tell you how much that means to me, and for some reason you are so sweet to me. Please let me catch up lol, you are literally winning this battle by a landslide. Every second you are with me, I am smiling so much that my jaw starts hurting. You are allowed to make my jaw hurt, but make it hurt by different things yk hehe.<br /><br />

    I hope you have an amazing day Meghu, thank you for being yourself. Please don't change anything about you, I love you so much as you are, and I want to make you feel it too when I meet you. I wanna take you out on nice dates, get you so many gifts and I want to make you feel safe and make you feel like you are at home. I feel like protecting you from everything bad, you are literally the most cute and innocent person ever.<br /><br />

    I love you and I miss you, can't wait for you to be back.<br /><br />
