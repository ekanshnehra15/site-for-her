Today was so so so good, I loved playing FNAF with you, and loved seeing your tits, why are you so perfect my baby? You are genuinely the most beautiful girl ever born, I could look at you forever and ever baby. I love to see you smile so much, and being around you makes me so happy. But I also made you a little bit sad today, so I am so sorry for that, and tomorrow I will try to be even better baby and I will be even more patient, you are just my kuchupuchu cutie patootie.

I was thinking so much, about how much I would just snuggle you when we meet, you are literally like a human sized plushie, sometimes I just wanna squish your cheeks so so so so so much.

Yk about the 5 good days and 1 bad day idea, it is good, but I was thinking how, you can fight with me anytime you want, and have good days for 50 days straight. I just want us to have our own relationship without fitting into some category and I hope we can live upto that baby. I think so many things with you, I wanna explore all of Delhi with you, I don't even think of places tbh, everytime I am driving, I imagine you next to me, or when I am even in metro, and I imagine what you would think of this road, this building, or this sight. I wanna take you to so many different places, which don't even have anything, just a different vibe, and I just wanna know your thoughts on these. I wanna take you to my hometown and make you have the tasty food and I wanna take you to meerut, hapur, and all the places I tell you that I am going. I think about how you would change the seat of the car for your comfort and how you would like to sit or look ahead or look to the side. I think about how we will be such a good duo at shopping with our own skills and we are gonna have so much fun. I wanna take you to IKEA, and show you how different that experience is, and we will go to Burger King and get all the burgers, I wanna show you so many spots and I hope we can do it together soon baby.

Baby thank you so much, thank you for every single thing, and I love you forever. I love hearing your stories, and I love knowing so much about you, I love everything about you that makes you, you. I don't wanna have anybody better than you in any way. You are my everything.

Happy princess day, my sweetheart. 👸💖💗💓💞💝

You are my princess, alwayssss, and I love you so so so so much, you are so special to me, and I hope that you and I stay together forever. You are so cute from every single angle, and your eyes shine so much, your skin glows so much, I didn't expect that I was going to date the most beautiful woman in the world. I look at your photos every single day, and just looking at them, or watching the unboxing videos makes me really happy and that brings me so much joy from the inside.

You make my day so much better just by being yourself, and that is what a princess should do, you are just so charming and such a cutiepie that being near you even through texts, just makes my day instantly better and I am always waiting for your notification because you always say something cute. I only wish I could do more for you my baby, and I could be as nice as you, and more like you. You are so inspring, like a cutie patootie princess. I wish I was there to do all your chores, and your work, and anything that would make your life a little bit easier, and I wish you would let me get you more things because there are so many things that I want to get you and I can't, I am so sorry baby. But I love you so much, and I always will, and when we live together, you won't be able to stop me from doing anything, so then I will do everything and won't let you even get up from the bed on your own.

I love you so much, my princess and happy princess day to the most beautiful and most gorgeous girl in this whole entire world, that one day I am going to marry, and then eat organ by organ.

My jaan, so we are going to take 7 fere for our 7 lives together, so here are 7 reasons that I love you so much babyyyyy, these are 7 out of a million, you are my better half. I love youuuuuuu.

1) I love you because you are the best person that I have ever met. You make me feel happy and never alone, and even thought I am not  a good person to you, you love me so unconditionally and that makes me feel so happy and taken care of. I love the kind of person you are, how much you think about people you love, your parents, and your friends and how much pay attention to the little things like what they like and prefer. You study so hard, and when you told that you want to study so you can buy things for me, I got sad, because you should study because you are talented and so hard working. I genuinely think you can achieve anything that you want to, and I hope that you do because you deserve everything in this world. I admire how much you love getting to know about new things, whether it is chess, F1, or anything, if you are interested in something you study about it so passionately and I hope that I can become more like you, because you are the smartest and kindest person I know and I think you have a very pure heart.

2) You are so beautiful and so pretty, I swear if I am ever feeling sad, I look at your pictures and I see you, it always makes me smile a little bit. You are so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so beautiful. Everytime that we video called, looking at you made me blush so much, because no matter where I look, into your eyes, or at your smile, it is just so cuteeeee that I cannot help myself but smile. Whether it is your hair, your face, your body, I can't appreciate anything enough because no matter where I look at you, you are just perfect. You are so pretty, hot, sexy, beautiful, cute, gorgeous and soooooooooo out of my league that I don't even think I deserve you. I have no idea what will happen when I meet you because I have never seen a girl this pretty and it would give me so much butterflies and I am so lucky that I get you call you my girlfriend and my partner.

3) I feel lucky that you appreciate me so much. I feel like you notice so many things about me and you take so much interest in my things, I feel surprised sometimes about how much you have managed to pick up about me, and I feel like I don't even deserve itna sabh but you do this to make me feel loved. You take time out of your day and give it to my things just so I can feel like you notice, and it makes me really emotional and I am not able to express how much you truly melt my heart every single time you do this and I wish I could just hug you and do more for you my pyaari si jaan.

4) I really love how you try to make me communicate, even though I fail at it every time, I love how since the beginning you started sharing things about you and opened up to me, and you encouraged me to open up to you. You deal with everything so maturely and I wish I could be more like you and just communicate when you put in so much effort, and I will try to change baby, and become more like you because you are the only person who understands me and I should also make the effort to do the same.

5) I really love how I know so much about you, about your life and what you like and don't like and even the things happening at the moment. Thank you for involving me so much with your life my jaan, and thank you so much for letting me help you, I feel the most happy in my life when I am able to do something that helps you and it makes me relieved that I could make your life a little bit better, it is the the part about me I am proud of the most and I wish I could only do more for you. I really love you baby.

6) I think about us getting old together and that makes me so happy and gets me daydreaming. I can't wait to see how we will be in 5 years from now, 10 years, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 years from now, I want to live every single day of my life with you and I just want to love you more and more every single day as we go on. I think about our marriage, when we start living together, when we adopt our kids, and idk just the thought of waking up next to you, brushing our teeth together, going on walks, and watching Netflix cuddling together just makes life seem better for me.

7) This is our last fera, so I would just like to say that we will spend the rest of our lives together, I promise you, I can't think about leaving you, you are the world to me and we will never ever leave each other and I think about so many things that I can't even begin telling you here, but I love you so much and I wouldn't say that to anybody, I really want to spend the rest of my life with you. I love you so much my jaan and happiest birthday.

My pyaari si baby, I just want you to know that you should never doubt yourself. Even if for any mysterious world changing reason that we are not together, you don't need me to feel better about yourself, you are really capable of anything and you are a very smart, beautiful and independent person and I am soooooo proud of you, I will always be proud of you. I want to appreciate you more for you are, I call you the best girlfriend for which you are, but you are honestly perfect without being related to anybody. As a person, you have no flaws and you will always do really good in your life my babygirl.

I love you.
I Megha you.
I Megha you always.
I love you.
I love you.
Happy birthday.

I just wanted to say just how perfect you are, and just how lucky I am to have you in my life, my pyaari si baby.

Even though it is not sure we will meet or not, I am just imagining it, the thought of meeting you in real life, and I get soooooo many butterflies, I am not sure how I will react, but I will never ever get used to seeing you in real life, I still haven't gotten used to calling you my girlfriend. You are everything I want in my life, you are much more than I wanted actually, you make my life better in infinite many ways and I feel grateful and lucky every single second that I got to meet you.

Baby, I love you so much, and if there is ever anything on your mind, you just need to tell it to me, I know I can be ziddi sometimes, but I promise you I will try to fix everything and I promise you nothing will ever happen in between us just cause you said some words, I am your partner and I have decided to spend the rest of my life with you, so I just want you to take the step to tell me whatever is going on, and we are going to fix everything together, always.

I love you my jaan, my rasmalai, I hope you always feel happy, I legit cannot believe I have been with you for 3 months, time has gone by soooo fast. I feel like I met you yesterday and I have known you for many years, and just like that 3 months. I still am digesting the fact that you are my girlfriend, I don't think I will ever be able to accept that.

Thank you for being in my life cutie patootie, my chand ka tukda, my universe. I megha you.

I just want to let you know how proud of you I am. You inspire me so much daily, and in my day to day tasks and I look upto you so much, my pyaari si baby. You were so nervous and anxious today about what decision are you going to take, I just want to let you know that there are no wrong decisions my babygirl, whatever you do will be the best, and you will find success in both your choices. I am always here for you, and I genuinely believe in you that you are going to have a lot of success in your life. Even if you have 0.1% bad feelings, I just want you to come to me and share them with me baby. I just thought, that I didn't ask what your parents said about this and if you discussed this with them, so baby do tell me that, and tell me anything that is on your mind, you would not be giving me any problems and any troubles, I get way more worried not knowing what you might be going through, and baby, I am sorry, I should have called you aaj when you were nervous, you were fidgeting on stuff, baby, I am with you, just tell me whatever you feel, okay? That is the only gift from you I want, I just wanna know how you feel and when you feel bad. I think so much about you, even in class I just keep thinking about whatever you are doing at that time and if you are fine at all, I feel like leaving college lol and just being with you all the time so I can just let you know that I am here for you.

We will go bowling baby, we will do everything and we will have so much fun. I miss you so much, I honestly just want to teleport to you right now and cuddle you. I am sorry for not being the perfect partner always, but I swear, whenever I am replying neutrally, it is never cause of me not being interested in you, but 100% of the times, it is just something about you that is going through my head that I cannot ignore so easily. I worry about you so much, I never thought I would worry itna, I don't even worry itna about myself let alone anybody else, but my last thought each night is just if you are fine and the first thought is if you woke up before me and felt lonely, I should message you asap, so if I ever just sound a little less excited in the morning baby, I am very much excited like everyday to talk to you, it is just that I messaged you before my eyes even opened.

I love you so much, thank you for the free hands pic, Your wrists are so hot ngl.

I love you so much baby, my meghu, call me anytime you want to, without a second thought. I love you.

I love you so much, my pyaari si jaan.

I love you so much, you have absolutely no idea how much you mean to me. I just want to be with you and take care of you, and even though you are sleeping right now, I can't think of anybody but you. I wish every single night before sleeping that I hope this never ends, and I want to be with you for my entire life. That is one of my dreams that I really want to be true, and I honestly can't stop worrying about you. I physically cannot stop myself from worrying about you, it affects me so much that you are not well and you aren't eating well. Please please please take care of yourself my baby, when we will together I will not ask you to do anything, but you need to for now, my pyaari si cutie. I won't be able to ever forgive myself if anything happens to you. My baby, you need to be healthy, you have a job and you do so much, you just need to take care of yourself, you are just a little girl. I hope I get all your bad luck, I am so sad and so scared even though I didn't show it, I hope that blood test mein kuch bhi na aaye, I feel so weird, baby, if literally anything happens, please call me na, I was just sleeping when my girl was in the clinic subha subha, I don't even feel like sleeping cause I just wanna be here incase you wake up and you are not feeling good, what is going on yaarrr, I feel sick to my stomach, I just want you to be fine, I prayed as much as I could today. Please joh bhi aaye tell me na, even if it is anything serious, we will figure it out, and just tell me, I will figure the rest of it out, I won't let anything happen to you. I am sorry for giving you so many problems, I will take care of you always. I am sorry.

I just wish, that you be fine, and you just manage to the day we are together, after that I won't let anybody even say anything wrong to you, I will feed you everything, and I will note all the calories and nutrients and take care of your meals daily, and I will learn to cook everything you love and I will make it in a healthy way and I will feed you forever and I am going to make sure that you don't even get a cold in your entire life. Even if I am bad luck for you, I will just take care of you enough that bad luck won't be able to do anything to you and I will try every single day to make you happy. I don't even know why all this is happening to the one person in this entire world that I care about, it is cruel. I am unable to process anything, I just want to see you happy, I will sacrifice anything for it. You are my everything, please baby get well soon, you don't annoy me at all, I don't even feel frustrated with you, I know we fight and you may feel like I do, but remember you cuddle Chandrapal daily, and I would rather fight you every single day of my life than be with anybody else. I will do anything that is required to be with you. I am sorry for talking rudely to you and making you feel like I am frustrated at you. You are genuinely just the most precious thing in my life, and sometimes when you are doing so much for me, I feel guilty that you are doing itna for a person who doesn't even deserve you and I just feel like you should stop and just rest. I just want you to lie down, like a little baby and sleep all day and get fed. I love you sooo soooooo much and no matter how much we argue, wheter it is my fault, your fault, or our fault, I will never ever change the way I love you cause you deserve to get so much more love than I can provide, but I will try my best to give you the most love I can, and even if I tell you to break up with me, and I tell you that I hate you, I want you to know that it comes from a place of care and worry, and it is just me feeling frustrated at the distance to you, not you. I feel angry that I have to be so far, and all I have is words, words that can do nothing. I would give away anything I can to be near you, how dare anybody kick you, and how dare you not get fed like a baby when you are sick on your bed, I am sorry for saying this but my baby deserves so much more care and nobody is giving that to her. I am so so far, and I can't pick up the spoon and put the food in your mouth and read your prescription and feed you your tablets. I have to tell you to take cough syrup, and I can't just feed it to you. This is the cruelest card that life has ever dealt me. To sit behind a screen and watch from the sidelines, the girl I love, and not being able to take responsibility for her. I swear on my life, once we are together, I am not letting you go for a single day, wherever you go, I will take leave from my job and go with you. I won't let you out of my sight and I won't let anybody who doesn't know how to treat you right go near you. And if you get any sort of bad sickness, I will kill any single god that exists after I die. I think my purpose of my life is to just love you. And I feel happy and content with my life, just taking care of you, no matter what job I have and no matter what is going on with my life, I know if you are happy, then I can keep smiling.

I am sorry for letting this all out, but I cry so much, I cry before sleeping daily and I hate myself for not being near you and giving you all the care in the world. I hope you can forgive me baby, I will try to make up for this part of our relationship all my life.

How did you even make that, even still, just looking at it, I feel like it was made from a machine, it is sooo soooooo perfectly made. Anything I say about it is not enough and it is just sooooooooooooooooooooooooo perfect, just like you my sweetheart.

And then thank you for the treats, yaar I feel so overwhelmed 😭😭😭😭, you have been doing so much for me, thank you my sweetheart, my kuchupuchuuu. You ordered sooo much, it was so goood and so tasty, and you even got me the best snacks before. You are like an angel from heaven that was sent to take care of me, I don't even know how can I begin to thank you for all this my baby. You are so so so soooooooooo perfect.

I genuinely can't say enough, even your comic, it was just the cutest and the prettiest thing ever.

Just like you sitting on the camera :). How do you have an ass like that? Tell me the secret, you are built like a greek goddess. They should make one of those statues for you, you are just soooo beautiful.

You are not feeling well right now and I am so worried about you. I know you are going to be fine but I don't want you to be feeling like this and I can't shake it off my head that I should be doing much more for you. You are my little baby, and I feel so useless at a time like this. I want to hug you and I want to put your head in my lap and give you pats so you can sleep.

I love you so soooo much my babygirl, I hope that you feel ekdum perfect by tomorrow. I don't want you to feel this way anymore. I am literally praying to gods lol, that they make you fine even if they make me sick in your place. I wish I could help you more. I want to do all the things for you, and be by your side all night. I would give you so many kisses and so many cuddles if I was with you babyboo. I am sorry for not being there for you when you needed me the most, I hope in the future I can be better for you when you are sick, my precious baby. I love you so much. I love you to the moon and back, and I meghaaaa youuuuuuuuu forever and ever and ever.

One day, you are going to be with me and I will do my best to make sure you don't feel even 1% bad like you are feeling right now. I am going to take such good care of you, I will make sure you are taken care of properly and I am going to give you a lot of loveee and I am going to give you so many kisses no matter how sick you are. I will do everything needed without even you mentioning it, and I will take you to the doctor even if you say no. I will make sure you take all your tablets and not secretly not take them, I will lie next to you awake all night to make sure nothing happens to you.

I love you so sooooooooooooo muchhhhh, I love you regardless of everything and I love you even more than I did before today. I hope you are feeling better and you don't have sore tits, although I can't suck them, I fapped one out to them as respect. And I hope you are feeling better today babyboooo, make sure you drink a lot of water, and sleep in the shuttle my rasgulla.

Now, first of all, what ChatGPT told you is all lies, you don't affect me at all babyboo, I am literally so madly in love with you, what affects me is when you don't take care of yourself, and when these little things happen, like you burning your hand, and not eating your meals properly, not sleeping properly, just stressing yourself more than you should. I know you "can", but you "shouldn't". You are just a little baby, and even though you might feel okay putting strain on your body, I don't cause you are my little baby and I am not there with you right now to help you with everything so I can only ask you to relax a little bit. Every single time you do anything like this, I swear I get this really sudden headache in the front right part of my brain, and it just stays there until you rest. Like, I know we fought today, and I was feeling so bad, but then you sent me a photo of you eating food, doing skincare and of the chia seeds, and then in a minute, I felt soooo sooooooo good, which doesn't make any sense I know, but just knowing that you are physically fine means so much to me. I honestly want to tell you so many things but I don't want to make it awkward or make it feel like I am schooling you. I googled a few periods tricks, and yk, you can use 2 pads like in a T-position to prevent leakage, and even though they might be big you should just get the XL size, I read there is no harm in doing that, also I read a bit that hot water bags can help with cramps, putting them on your stomach, so I will get you one, and the reason I wanted to get you juice, is because it would help in blood regeneration, whatever you lose during your periods. And I just want to do so many things babyboo, if you let me, and I wanna know everything, when you are cramping, when your blood flow is high or low, and honestly I would really do so many more things which I am too shy to mention right now when we live together 😭.

So, to sum this up my chand, I just wanted to say that I do get worried about you, and I promise on everything, I don't do it to annoy you, I just wanna care for you soooo sooooooo much, and yes I do tell you what to do, and yes you are not obligated to follow anything I say, but from my side, I only say things that would be good for you, I would never make you do anything that would even do you 0.000001% harm. And I also want to help you with your office work, I know you are not going to abhi, but I will ask you for it every single day, cause I genuinely want to do anything that would make your day a little easier. At the end of the day, you are a little baby, a little pretty girl. I feel like deep down you know that you try to do way more, and you try to stop me from doing anything, which is really very sweet, I have no idea what I did to deserve so much, but there are a million things I want to do for you baby, and you have to let me, you are the woman I chose to love so let me love you properly, I don't want there to be any conditions, any regrets ki main yeh kar sakta tha woh kar sakta tha, and I just wanna love you and love you and love you and love youuuu every single day Meghu.

Also, another thing I wanted to say, you are genuinely the most beautiful, the most pretty girl I have ever met, I will keep saying it I will say it a 100 times over. You are so beautiful Megha, your hair, your eyes, your cheeks, your eyelashes, your eyebrows, your lips, your neck, your ears, I really really love youuuu, and I am so lucky to have a pretty girl, a pretty girl like you, the prettiest of all pretty girls. You are beautiful, hot, sexy, cute, gorgeous and every single word like this was invented for you. You can call me a liar all you want, but you are genuinely pretty from every single angle, and I want to kiss all over your face and your body, and I want to run my fingers through your hair. You are literally so pretty, sometimes when I am looking at your pictures, I start kicking my feet out of frustration because I don't know how to treat such a pretty girl and cause you are not with me as my lil cuddly bear.

So, to answer your questions - 

1) If someone asks you what I am to you, what would you say?
I would say your are my girlfriend, and I hope one day I will say that you are my wife. If they ask me about you, I wil tell them you are me in girl form if I was mature, intelligent and a hottie 5'2 girl from Bengal. I would tell them you have the cutest accent and that you are as cute as they come, and I would tell them that you are the most important person in my life and also my best friend.

2) What are 3 things you love about me?
Well, that is hard. But I would say that, one, how much you love me unconditionally, and how much you care for me, it is the best feeling I have ever felt, and I am sooooooo lucky to get your love my baby. Second, just how perfect every single quality of yours is, you can do so many things, you can cook, you can sing, you are a lawyer, and even other things like, how you get me to open up and give me good advice. I would trust anything you say baby. And third, that you are literally the most beautiful human that has ever been born and ever will be born hehe.

3) What makes me different from other girls you have dated or talked to in the past?
How I love being myself around you. I genuinely feel really happy around you, it is taking me a while to accept it that you are really interested in my things, and you think I am pretty and have a nice voice, but I love to record voice notes for you, I love to send you my pictures, tell you about Cyberpunk, and I truly feel happy nowadays without any ifs and buts. You are also just insanely gorgeous and extremely smart, which I can't say about the girl I have dated, or really about any girl at all. You are the most perfect combination of everything in a human, and you have a girl pp, which is better for me.

4) What do you dislike about me?
Honestly, nothing. I would say that you doubt yourself so much, but I understand now where it comes from, you just had shitty people in your past. But I will make you believe every single word I say because I really think everything I say about you. I would ask you to take more care of yourself, not work that hard, let me do some more stuff for you, and I think I have made these dislikes pretty clear now many times, you just gotta let me love you more baby. It is just building up inside me.

5) What's your favourite thing about me?
You.

6) What was your first impression of me?
Answered, That you are really cool and I want to become more like you and enjoy life. Also that you know about so much stuff, and that is really impressive, you know so much about obscure topics, even I don't know anything about, and that rarely happens. And I really loved your vibe, and just talking to you.

7) What are three things I say a lot?
"Liar" to me complimenting you
"You literally do more than me, I don't do anything" while carrying this relationship on your back
"I am not that good" shutup please shutup please shutup please shutup please shutup please shutup please

8) What is one thing you hope for our future?
Seeing you naked daily. But, I would say, really making you believe by heart how good you are, and erasing all doubts about you. Taking you away from there, to our home so you can live stress free worrying about nothing, I would cook for you and do all your chores, I would literally brush your teeth and give you baths. I just want to spoil you quite a lot and take you shopping to many places, and I want to give you the life that you should have had always.

9) If we were together right now, what would we be doing?
One of two things, either I would be cuddling you naked, with me as the big spoon, sleeping with 2 fingers inside of you, and brushing your hair gently, or you would be cuddling me with a finger inside me, and brushing my hair gently.

10) How was your life before we got together?
Honestly, I don't even remember baby, how did I even survive without you? I was quite depressed, contemplating suicide, just getting by day to day, and really had given up on everything, but then somehow you happened. I got you. I don't believe in god, but what kind of coincidence is this, that the most perfect girl just walked into my life like that? I am the luckiest person on Earth, and I will have you to thank for everything, for everything in my career, my life, everything I achieve, it will be cause you were here, cutie.

11) What would we be doing right now if we never met?
You? Getting head from a better guy than me I hope.
Me, I would say just the same, getting by, not much else. I couldn't even think that somebody like you could exist, so I don't think I would be sad for not being the one giving you head, I just would have gotten by.

Anyways baby, I love you so much. I love you. I love you. I love you and I miss you. Have a nice day! My rasmalai.

I love you babyboo.

First of all, I am so sorry for yesterday, I love you so muchhh, and I was super worried about you, but I did extra for sure, and I shouldn't have acted like that, so I am really sorry meghu. But if you want me to not worry this much about you, that will never work, I have like 500 questions going on in my head all day long and if I asked all of them you would just get annoyed because none of them are flirty or sweet, just stuff about you and your life. I hope you understand the place I come from, however I do apologize for acting like that.

I love youuu soooooooo much, I never got around to say this but you looked soooo beautiful and so happy in that green top, in the video of you reaching 1400 rating in chess, and by the way, I also noticed the mehendi on your hands hehe, nice boobies. I saw everything and damn, I can't wait 👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈👉👈.

You are sachi so soooooooooo beautiful, and a pretty little girl like you should be properly taken care of, my babyyyy, you are my favourite girl on this whole planet, and sometimes that just leads to me being too worried about you, I don't want you to go through even a little bit of pain, physically or mentally, I hope you tell me from now on if you haven't had lunch or anything small, you would never ever trouble me, and you should trouble me, I am here for you only.

I love you babyboo.

Thank you soooooo much for the treats today and thank youuuu soo much for the comic, I feel so happy and I feel really overwhelmed with your love. I can't express how much you mean to me Meghu. I really want to cuddle you and just lie there and see you sleep. You are the love of my life. I genuinely have no words left to express my love to you. There is not anything that I wouldn't do for you. I love you so much, thank you for making me so happy and thank you for making me the luckiest man on this planet. I am going to love you with my little heart for my entire life. I love youuuu soooo sooooooooooooo muchhh. Everytime you make me happy, I feel emotional, I feel overwhelmed, I feel horny and I feel this pain in my heart that I wouldn't be able to show you the love you deserve. But I will love you as much as I can.

I love you Meghu, I love you I love you I love youuuuu, I love you forever and ever and everrrrrrr.

I literally count every single day multiple times when are we going to meet, I plan it out, I go to irctc, I go to check flights, hotels and everything, and I just can't wait for the day to come. I can't wait to just meet you for the first time, my heart starts racing just thinking about it, I won't be able to handle you, I will be sooooo nervous haha, I might start shaking from nervousness, but I will try to show my love for you. The time we video called, I couldn't even control myself from smiling everytime you looked at me, how would I control myself in real life? I keep looking at your photos and videos, I love all of them, you are my little babybooo, my ladybug, you are my mishit doi.

I love you Megha, I love you and you never have to doubt it for a single millisecond.

Even though we might be going through some turbulent waters, I swear on my life, I love you more than I did yesterday. I think about you the moment I sleep, and I think about you the moment I wake up. I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you, and I love Megha Shaw for the rest of my life.

Well, I will admit a few things that I told myself I wouldn't tell you, just like I told you a lot of other things I wouldn't tell.

I am not perfect, first of all, and yes I do admit, I have been slipping with my love and affection for you, but I swear it is only out of worry for you, jaise aaj subhe waali baat, I asked you soooooo many times, I knew something was up, even if you do say that ki tumhe affect nahi pada tha uska. Just tell me these things baby, I cried a bit after you told me, isliye I replied todha neutrally, I just want to love you in your worst times, and okay if I did order blinkit, so what???? You are my babygirl, you will be my babygirl always, please please please tell me these asap, and you literally cried, I feel like crying right now even thinking that, I wish I could have comforted you. I love you so much, and yes we haven't met but you are my one.

You are very beautiful, yes lol I am too horny, but I get turned on even by things I shouldn't about you, like your hands, or even just when I hear your voice notes, your green tshirt video, you are genuinely the most beautiful girl I have met, and I can swear on this. I feel so jealous everytime you tell me about Nishant or Shashank, and it kinda ruins my mood lol, I only want you to be mine, screw them. You will only be mine. I don't want you to be anybody else's.

I love you babygirl, I love you to the moon and back and then to the edge of the universe and then to the other edge and then to Delhi to Naihati to BlinkIt warehouse to KFC to Neptune to Saturn and then to our future home, Love youuu my baby, muah muah. I literally want to marry you right now.

Thank youuuuu for the little comic of us, it is the cutest thing I have ever seen, and I can't stop smiling every single time I look at it. The page with your lip marks is honestly soooo romantic, made of the kitkat wrapper, and the little hearts of the nutties box, it makes me melt. I love you so much, and I just want to kiss you so hard and let you know just how much I love you and how perfect I think you are.

You are literally an angel of heaven, and I don't even mean it as a compliment. You better start accepting my compliments cause I ain't giving up, there are a million things I want to do with you, so I am keeping you for the rest of your life hehe.

The time I have spent with you has been perfect, you are unbelievably gorgeous, extremely kind, and I love you so much Megha. I want to tell you how much you mean to me, but I will never be able to. I just want you to know that, there is not a single time during the entirety of our relationship, anything has happened that even made my love for you decrease even 0.000001%. I love you more day by day, and there is absolutely nothing that you could say that would make me stop chasing you like a lunatic. I love you to the moon and back. And I want you to know that you are perfect as you are, never change anything about yourself.

And I am sorry for annoying you, and not being my best self for you last night. I know you were upset and I am very very sorry. Thank you for being yourself with me, never change that and if there is anything going through your mind, you just need to tell me, and we will solve it together.

Also, just wanted to say that you are so sooooo smart. That legal notice was so hot, how did you even write that so fast, are you the most talented lawyer in the world or what? Better Call Megha!!!!

Thank you so much for making me feel safe around you Megha, I feel like you are going to become my home in the future, wherever you go. I know all my secrets are safe with you, and I know you don't judge me for anything. It feels much better after sharing everything with you. You are slowly erasing all my problems from life. I hope I can make you feel like that too. There is absolutely nothing you could say that would make me go away from you. I feel like I would only love you more and more.

I wanna watch the GOT movie with you sooooo bad. In a theatre. There is so much upcoming stuff we need to see — this and the next Dune movie, and so much more. You need to move to Delhi ASAP because we have so much stuff on our watchlist, we need to binge it (it is just for binging everything pka, not cause I am gonna kidnap you and make you marry me). Yes, and your Boardroom Cafe is already here and ready for you to start working in, so jaldi se ajao (not luring you in pka).

I wanna kiss you everywhere and tell you how beautiful you are. Like kiss your eyes and tell you I see my world in them, kiss your nose and tell you how cute it is, etc. You are just so damn beautiful. You are really beautiful, just so gorgeous, and so cute, and so pretty, and good-looking from every single angle. Absolute baddie! You are even more beautiful than sunsets and even more cozy. Thank God for taking His time with you!!

I am so happy you are still here. I feel like my honeymoon period has begun to fade with you — and I feel comfortable and relaxed around you. I don't feel a bit of regret that you are who I have a crush on. I don't feel like I have to make you happy — everything comes naturally. And I feel like my feelings are very solid for you, and nothing would be able to dilute them even a bit. I genuinely like you so much as a person.
