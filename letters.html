Good afternoon meghuuuu,<br /><br />

I love youuu sooooooooooooooooo muchhhhh.<br /><br />

See, nothing can stop me from writing a letter for you, I am good at finding loopholes, like a lawyer hehe.<br /><br />

First of all, I am so sorry for yesterday, I love you so muchhh, and I was super worried about you, but I did extra for sure, and I shouldn't have acted like that, so I am really sorry meghu. But if you want me to not worry this much about you, that will never work, I have like 500 questions going on in my head all day long and if I asked all of them you would just get annoyed because none of them are flirty or sweet, just stuff about you and your life. I hope you understand the place I come from, however I do apologize for acting like that.<br /><br />

I love youuu soooooooo much, I never got around to say this but you looked soooo beautiful and so happy in that green top, in the video of you reaching 1400 rating in chess, and by the way, I also noticed the mehendi on your hands hehe, nice boobies. I saw everything and damn, I can't wait üëâüëàüëâüëàüëâüëàüëâüëàüëâüëàüëâüëàüëâüëàüëâüëà.<br /><br />

You are sachi so soooooooooo beautiful, and a pretty little girl like you should be properly taken care of, my babyyyy, you are my favourite girl on this whole planet, and sometimes that just leads to me being too worried about you, I don't want you to go through even a little bit of pain, physically or mentally, I hope you tell me from now on if you haven't had lunch or anything small, you would never ever trouble me, and you should trouble me, I am here for you only.<br /><br />

I love you babyboo.<br /><br />

I meghhhaaaaaaaaa youuuu. &lt;3<br /><br />

Thank you soooooo much for the treats today and thank youuuu soo much for the comic, I feel so happy and I feel really overwhelmed with your love. I can't express how much you mean to me Meghu. I really want to cuddle you and just lie there and see you sleep. You are the love of my life. I genuinely have no words left to express my love to you. There is not anything that I wouldn't do for you. I love you so much, thank you for making me so happy and thank you for making me the luckiest man on this planet. I am going to love you with my little heart for my entire life. I love youuuu soooo sooooooooooooo muchhh. Everytime you make me happy, I feel emotional, I feel overwhelmed, I feel horny and I feel this pain in my heart that I wouldn't be able to show you the love you deserve. But I will love you as much as I can.<br /><br />

I love you Meghu, I love you I love you I love youuuuu, I love you forever and ever and everrrrrrr.<br /><br />

I literally count every single day multiple times when are we going to meet, I plan it out, I go to irctc, I go to check flights, hotels and everything, and I just can't wait for the day to come. I can't wait to just meet you for the first time, my heart starts racing just thinking about it, I won't be able to handle you, I will be sooooo nervous haha, I might start shaking from nervousness, but I will try to show my love for you. The time we video called, I couldn't even control myself from smiling everytime you looked at me, how would I control myself in real life? I keep looking at your photos and videos, I love all of them, you are my little babybooo, my ladybug, you are my mishit doi.<br /><br />

I love you Megha, I love you and you never have to doubt it for a single millisecond.<br /><br />

My one and only ganeshu,<br /><br />

I love youuu sooo sooooo muchhhh, and I know you won't admit it, but you slept last night thinking that my love for you isn't the same.<br /><br />

Even though we might be going through some turbulent waters, I swear on my life, I love you more than I did yesterday. I think about you the moment I sleep, and I think about you the moment I wake up. I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you, and I love Megha Shaw for the rest of my life.<br /><br />

Well, I will admit a few things that I told myself I wouldn't tell you, just like I told you a lot of other things I wouldn't tell.<br /><br />

I am not perfect, first of all, and yes I do admit, I have been slipping with my love and affection for you, but I swear it is only out of worry for you, jaise aaj subhe waali baat, I asked you soooooo many times, I knew something was up, even if you do say that ki tumhe affect nahi pada tha uska. Just tell me these things baby, I cried a bit after you told me, isliye I replied todha neutrally, I just want to love you in your worst times, and okay if I did order blinkit, so what???? You are my babygirl, you will be my babygirl always, please please please tell me these asap, and you literally cried, I feel like crying right now even thinking that, I wish I could have comforted you. I love you so much, and yes we haven't met but you are my one.<br /><br />

You are very beautiful, yes lol I am too horny, but I get turned on even by things I shouldn't about you, like your hands, or even just when I hear your voice notes, your green tshirt video, you are genuinely the most beautiful girl I have met, and I can swear on this. I feel so jealous everytime you tell me about Nishant or Shashank, and it kinda ruins my mood lol, I only want you to be mine, screw them. You will only be mine. I don't want you to be anybody else's.<br /><br />

I love you babygirl, I love you to the moon and back and then to the edge of the universe and then to the other edge and then to Delhi to Naihati to BlinkIt warehouse to KFC to Neptune to Saturn and then to our future home, Love youuu my baby, muah muah. I literally want to marry you right now.<br /><br />

Dear Baby,<br /><br />

I meghhaaaa youuuuu. &lt;3<br /><br />

I just wanted to let you know how beautiful you are, I literally cannot take my eyes off of you, and I want to let you know how pretty and gorgeous you are. You look good in hot dresses, in traditional, when you are about to sleep, when you just came out of the shower, you are genuinely soooo beautiful.<br /><br />

Thank youuuuu for the little comic of us, it is the cutest thing I have ever seen, and I can't stop smiling every single time I look at it. The page with your lip marks is honestly soooo romantic, made of the kitkat wrapper, and the little hearts of the nutties box, it makes me melt. I love you so much, and I just want to kiss you so hard and let you know just how much I love you and how perfect I think you are.<br /><br />

You are literally an angel of heaven, and I don't even mean it as a compliment. You better start accepting my compliments cause I ain't giving up, there are a million things I want to do with you, so I am keeping you for the rest of your life hehe.<br /><br />

I megghaaaaaa youuuuuuuuuu &lt;3<br /><br />

Dear kishmish,<br /><br />

I wish you a very veryyyy happy girlfriend's day!<br /><br />

Although you are not officially my girlfriend, you are unofficially my wife, and I just want to thank you so much for being in my life, you big beautiful perfect little baby.<br /><br />

The time I have spent with you has been perfect, you are unbelievably gorgeous, extremely kind, and I love you so much Megha. I want to tell you how much you mean to me, but I will never be able to. I just want you to know that, there is not a single time during the entirety of our relationship, anything has happened that even made my love for you decrease even 0.000001%. I love you more day by day, and there is absolutely nothing that you could say that would make me stop chasing you like a lunatic. I love you to the moon and back. And I want you to know that you are perfect as you are, never change anything about yourself.<br /><br />

And I am sorry for annoying you, and not being my best self for you last night. I know you were upset and I am very very sorry. Thank you for being yourself with me, never change that and if there is anything going through your mind, you just need to tell me, and we will solve it together.<br /><br />

Also, just wanted to say that you are so sooooo smart. That legal notice was so hot, how did you even write that so fast, are you the most talented lawyer in the world or what? Better Call Megha!!!!<br /><br />

Yet you love me so much, I could never even dream of a girl like you, you are so perfect, I honestly wanna marry you right now, and I want to just hold you and sleep and not wake up for a while.<br /><br />

It is my fault, and I apologise, I am very sorry for making you cry, and I am sorry for not being who you deserve today.

My sweet potato,<br /><br />

I love youuuuuuuu.<br /><br />

I just want to let you know how much I love you my baby. You mean so much to me.<br /><br />

I feel so comforted around you, and so safe, I feel like being myself, I don't feel like I don't have to not send voice notes cause I have a bad voice or I look bad. If anything, I can't wait until you will see me naked, I just want you to see all of me. You make me feel good, not even normal, but good in my own skin. Which I can't say about anybody else.<br /><br />

You made me open up about my trauma and you made me feel not ashamed about it. Even if you say this is not true, but I know, everybody would not be like this, and I am very grateful I told you as much as I did and there are so many other things I feel like I am ready to share with you, thank you meghuu.<br /><br />

And I want to make you feel how good you are, I want you to feel that you are one of the best girls I have ever talked to, and the best person in my life. I trust you and I love you. I want you to feel your worth because you are so precious and you have so many qualities that I want to copy paste to myself. I want to be around you, and learn from you and I want to hug you and kiss you and make you feel how much love is filled inside me for you. I love you. My sweetheart. Thank you for being yourself with me, I would not change anything about you, I swear YOU are one of a kind meghu, and I am so scared to lose you cause I will never meet somebody like you.<br /><br />

I love you. Grow old with me, yeah?<br /><br />

    I love you to the moon and back, and I megha you so much.<br /><br />

    I can't stop thinking about my future with you, you told me why are we thinking so far ahead in the future.

    Hi, I hope you are doing amazing, and I hope you have a beautiful day ‚Äî as beautiful as you.<br /><br />

    But that will be really hard, because you are the most beautiful thing in this universe. Born too late to see dinosaurs, born too early to explore space, but born at the right time to be with the most beautiful girl to ever live. I love you so much. I want you to lie on top of me and I want to whisper in your ears every single thing about you I am obsessed with. I wish I could freeze time and just look at you for eternity.<br /><br />

    Pretty face, pretty nose, pretty eyes, pretty lips, pretty hair, nice boobs, good body, and hands I want to put a ring on. Hehe.<br /><br />

    I wanted to thank you ‚Äî I will thank you every day I can in my life ‚Äî because you are the best person I have ever met, and you make me smile all day. Even though my jaw has started to hurt from all the smiling and my heart can't handle your sweetness.<br /><br />

    I love you a lot Meghu. I am missing you, I am dreaming about you, and I hope I am having very sweet dreams about you ‚Äî where I am holding your hands and looking into your eyes. You are genuinely so cool and so amazing. I am lucky to have you in my life ‚Äî and so is anybody.<br /><br />

I know all my secrets are safe with you, and I know you don't judge me for anything. It feels much better after sharing everything with you. You are slowly erasing all my problems from life. I hope I can make you feel like that too. There is absolutely nothing you could say that would make me go away from you. I feel like I would only love you more and more.<br /><br />

    I wanna watch the GOT movie with you sooooo bad. In a theatre. There is so much upcoming stuff we need to see ‚Äî this and the next Dune movie, and so much more. You need to move to Delhi ASAP because we have so much stuff on our watchlist, we need to binge it (it is just for binging everything pka, not cause I am gonna kidnap you and make you marry me). Yes, and your Boardroom Cafe is already here and ready for you to start working in, so jaldi se ajao (not luring you in pka).<br /><br />

    I wanna kiss you everywhere and tell you how beautiful you are. Like kiss your eyes and tell you I see my world in them, kiss your nose and tell you how cute it is, etc. You are just so damn beautiful. You are really beautiful, just so gorgeous, and so cute, and so pretty, and good-looking from every single angle. Absolute baddie! You are even more beautiful than sunsets and even more cozy. Thank God for taking His time with you!!<br /><br />

    I am so happy you are still here. I feel like my honeymoon period has begun to fade with you ‚Äî and I feel comfortable and relaxed around you. I don't feel a bit of regret that you are who I have a crush on. I don't feel like I have to make you happy ‚Äî everything comes naturally. And I feel like my feelings are very solid for you, and nothing would be able to dilute them even a bit. I genuinely like you so much as a person.<br /><br />

    Dear Megha,<br /><br />

    Thank you so much for today. I am still blushing from the endless compliments you gave me. I have said this many times but it can't be said enough times that you are such an amazing person.<br /><br />

    I already hold you so dear to me and honestly if you told me to do anything for you, I would give it the best shot I can even if I can't do it, and I hope you know, whatever problem arises for you, you need to share it with me cause it is our problem. You can literally share anything to me, at any time, never think if it is the right time or not.<br /><br />

    I wish we meet really soon cause I can't stop thinking about you. I just wanna see your beauty in real life, and see how pretty you really are. I might get a heart attack to be honest when I look into your eyes. I wanna touch you, and hold your cheeks and see how soft they really are. So many things I wanna do with you and to you. I want to hold you and tell you that I love you so many times.<br /><br />

    You are so fucking amazing, like stop making me fall in love with you even more. Do you know I won't literally be able to fall in love with anybody else now cause I met you? Honestly, you should take the blame of being so perfect and being so nice to me. I hope you do know that I will always blame you for it.<br /><br />

    You seem like the most genuine person on earth, you listen to everything I say and you remember it, that means soooooo much to me I can't tell you how much that means to me, and for some reason you are so sweet to me. Please let me catch up lol, you are literally winning this battle by a landslide. Every second you are with me, I am smiling so much that my jaw starts hurting. You are allowed to make my jaw hurt, but make it hurt by different things yk hehe.<br /><br />

    I hope you have an amazing day Meghu, thank you for being yourself. Please don't change anything about you, I love you so much as you are, and I want to make you feel it too when I meet you. I wanna take you out on nice dates, get you so many gifts and I want to make you feel safe and make you feel like you are at home. I feel like protecting you from everything bad, you are literally the most cute and innocent person ever.<br /><br />

    I love you and I miss you, can't wait for you to be back.<br /><br />

        Dear Baby,<br /><br />

        Hiiii, have been skipping letters for a few days now so I will try to get back into habit.<br />
        First of all, I didn't really get to express just how pretty you are. I have looked at the video you let me save countless times. You are soooooo pretty. Your eyes are literally so perfect, and your nose, your cheeks, and your lips. I can't stop looking at you. I love the way your hair falls on your shoulders. I genuinely wanna hold you and hug you tightly for so long. You look so good, I can't believe still that you look so good.<br /><br />

        I want to thank you so much for doing so much for me and being here for me. You have no idea ‚Äî pretty much every other text from you makes me smile ear to ear.<br /><br />

        Thank you so much for being yourself, I don't want you to change ever, even a bit.<br />
        I really want to meet you so badly, I want to be near you. I feel frustrated, wish we could skip to the days where we are near each other. I am going to take care of you for all my life.<br /><br />

        Also, sorry for sending you to study. I hope you know I only say it for you. My greedy self wants you to be on top of me instead.<br /><br />
