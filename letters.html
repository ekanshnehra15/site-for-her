    Dear Ms. Shaw,<br /><br />

    Hi, I hope you are doing amazing, and I hope you have a beautiful day — as beautiful as you.<br /><br />

    But that will be really hard, because you are the most beautiful thing in this universe. Born too late to see dinosaurs, born too early to explore space, but born at the right time to be with the most beautiful girl to ever live. I love you so much. I want you to lie on top of me and I want to whisper in your ears every single thing about you I am obsessed with. I wish I could freeze time and just look at you for eternity.<br /><br />

    Pretty face, pretty nose, pretty eyes, pretty lips, pretty hair, nice boobs, good body, and hands I want to put a ring on. Hehe.<br /><br />

    I wanted to thank you — I will thank you every day I can in my life — because you are the best person I have ever met, and you make me smile all day. Even though my jaw has started to hurt from all the smiling and my heart can't handle your sweetness.<br /><br />

    I love you a lot Meghu. I am missing you, I am dreaming about you, and I hope I am having very sweet dreams about you — where I am holding your hands and looking into your eyes. You are genuinely so cool and so amazing. I am lucky to have you in my life — and so is anybody.<br /><br />

    Never change and keep smiling cutie.<br />
    And keep yourself hydrated.<br /><br />

    ❤️<br />

  <p>
    Dear sweetheart,<br /><br />

    Good morning to the prettiest girl on the planet. I hope you have a lovely day ahead.<br /><br />

    Thank you so much for making me feel safe around you Megha, I feel like you are going to become my home in the future, wherever you go. I know all my secrets are safe with you, and I know you don't judge me for anything. It feels much better after sharing everything with you. You are slowly erasing all my problems from life. I hope I can make you feel like that too. There is absolutely nothing you could say that would make me go away from you. I feel like I would only love you more and more.<br /><br />

    I wanna watch the GOT movie with you sooooo bad. In a theatre. There is so much upcoming stuff we need to see — this and the next Dune movie, and so much more. You need to move to Delhi ASAP because we have so much stuff on our watchlist, we need to binge it (it is just for binging everything pka, not cause I am gonna kidnap you and make you marry me). Yes, and your Boardroom Cafe is already here and ready for you to start working in, so jaldi se ajao (not luring you in pka).<br /><br />

    I wanna kiss you everywhere and tell you how beautiful you are. Like kiss your eyes and tell you I see my world in them, kiss your nose and tell you how cute it is, etc. You are just so damn beautiful. You are really beautiful, just so gorgeous, and so cute, and so pretty, and good-looking from every single angle. Absolute baddie! You are even more beautiful than sunsets and even more cozy. Thank God for taking His time with you!!<br /><br />

    I am so happy you are still here. I feel like my honeymoon period has begun to fade with you — and I feel comfortable and relaxed around you. I don't feel a bit of regret that you are who I have a crush on. I don't feel like I have to make you happy — everything comes naturally. And I feel like my feelings are very solid for you, and nothing would be able to dilute them even a bit. I genuinely like you so much as a person.<br /><br />

    ❤️<br />

  <p>
    Dear Megha,<br /><br />

    Thank you so much for today. I am still blushing from the endless compliments you gave me. I have said this many times but it can't be said enough times that you are such an amazing person.<br /><br />

    I already hold you so dear to me and honestly if you told me to do anything for you, I would give it the best shot I can even if I can't do it, and I hope you know, whatever problem arises for you, you need to share it with me cause it is our problem. You can literally share anything to me, at any time, never think if it is the right time or not.<br /><br />

    I wish we meet really soon cause I can't stop thinking about you. I just wanna see your beauty in real life, and see how pretty you really are. I might get a heart attack to be honest when I look into your eyes. I wanna touch you, and hold your cheeks and see how soft they really are. So many things I wanna do with you and to you. I want to hold you and tell you that I love you so many times.<br /><br />

    You are so fucking amazing, like stop making me fall in love with you even more. Do you know I won't literally be able to fall in love with anybody else now cause I met you? Honestly, you should take the blame of being so perfect and being so nice to me. I hope you do know that I will always blame you for it.<br /><br />

    You seem like the most genuine person on earth, you listen to everything I say and you remember it, that means soooooo much to me I can't tell you how much that means to me, and for some reason you are so sweet to me. Please let me catch up lol, you are literally winning this battle by a landslide. Every second you are with me, I am smiling so much that my jaw starts hurting. You are allowed to make my jaw hurt, but make it hurt by different things yk hehe.<br /><br />

    I hope you have an amazing day Meghu, thank you for being yourself. Please don't change anything about you, I love you so much as you are, and I want to make you feel it too when I meet you. I wanna take you out on nice dates, get you so many gifts and I want to make you feel safe and make you feel like you are at home. I feel like protecting you from everything bad, you are literally the most cute and innocent person ever.<br /><br />

    I love you and I miss you, can't wait for you to be back.<br /><br />

    ❤️<br />

        Dear Baby,<br /><br />

        Hiiii, have been skipping letters for a few days now so I will try to get back into habit.<br />
        First of all, I didn't really get to express just how pretty you are. I have looked at the video you let me save countless times. You are soooooo pretty. Your eyes are literally so perfect, and your nose, your cheeks, and your lips. I can't stop looking at you. I love the way your hair falls on your shoulders. I genuinely wanna hold you and hug you tightly for so long. You look so good, I can't believe still that you look so good.<br /><br />

        I want to thank you so much for doing so much for me and being here for me. You have no idea — pretty much every other text from you makes me smile ear to ear.<br /><br />

        Thank you so much for being yourself, I don't want you to change ever, even a bit.<br />
        I really want to meet you so badly, I want to be near you. I feel frustrated, wish we could skip to the days where we are near each other. I am going to take care of you for all my life.<br /><br />

        Also, sorry for sending you to study. I hope you know I only say it for you. My greedy self wants you to be on top of me instead.<br /><br />
